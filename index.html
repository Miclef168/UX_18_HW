                <h3>Collaborative Skills</h3>
                <p> Whether it is in research or design, I consider collaboration and teamwork core to my work ethic. I believe anything and everything is better when people work together, and I pride myself on my ability to work with anyone.</p>

                <h3>UX Research</h3>
                <p>Curiosity is at the center of who I am. Whether it is a user issue or a new feature, I want t understand the problem, the people affected, and I want to be solution oriented. For this reason I have worked hard at my research and interviewing skills so I can help create the best solution.</p>

                <h3>UX Writing</h3>
                <p>You don't work in film or teach four different writing subjects without having to hone your skills. I believe words can make the difference. My writing is professional but accessible, pointed by fair. I try to write in a way that anyone can understand.</p>
